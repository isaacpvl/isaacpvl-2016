		h1 Being passionate isn't a cliche. <strong>It's a dope-ass super power.</strong>
		p When I was 16 years-old, I dropped out of high school to go full-time with the freelance design work I was doing. Since then, I've moved around the country, worked for a few different agencies, and went through the wringer in the startup world. I currently live and work independently between NYC and Chicago.
		p Part of me lives for unique experiences. I invite strangers to crash at my place through couchsurfing.com, practice public improv challenges, and climb urban structures. My typical weekend involves skateboarding all over the city covered in glitter and dressed head to toe as Spider-Man, eyes open for opportunities to explore new places and meet new people.
		p I'm always open to hearing from anyone interested in working together, but regardless, I'd never say no to a chance to meet someone new and climb a tree together or something.
