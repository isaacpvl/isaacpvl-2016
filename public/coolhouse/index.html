The campers were 8 startup teams, and I left the big city for the summer to help them. <em>Especially with gaining the interest of investors and potential users.</em></p><p>I learned about them and their missions and found the right voice for their brands. I designed the structure and interfaces that made sense to build as their first version products. I showed off their potential through landing pages and prototypes of the future.</p></div><div class="context"><div><h6 class="caps">Role:</h6><p>camp counselor</p></div><div><h6 class="caps">When:</h6><p>summer 2014 <em>(3-month program)</em></p></div><div><h6 class="caps">With:</h6><p>Coolhouse Labs, accelerator</p></div></div></div></div><div class="itemhead"><h2>Showreel</h2></div><div class="visual full"><div class="shot"><video id="video" preload="auto" controls="true" poster="/images/coolhouse/showreel-poster.jpg"><source src="/images/coolhouse/showreel.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="/images/coolhouse/showreel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div><div class="detail"><p>After 6 full weeks of the program (the halfway point) I created a showreel for Coolhouse Labs itself to use to impress its own investors (it worked.) However, it features the design work that had been done so far on each of the startups themselves, showing off the new brands alongside prototypes of the in-progress, soon-to-be products.</p><p>I should note, I had next to nothing to do with the last couple projects in the video, especially Cotalented and LeaseMaid. Their need for my help wasn't nearly as heavy. <em class="sidenote">(or else I would've died.)</em></p></div><div class="itemhead"><h2>Localfu</h2></div><div class="visual full"><div class="browser large"><div class="top"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><span>localfu.com</span></div><video preload="auto" autoplay="true" loop="loop" muted="muted" poster="/images/coolhouse/localfu-landing-poster.jpg"><source src="/images/coolhouse/localfu-landing.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="/images/coolhouse/localfu-landing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div><div class="detail"><p>Now this is a weird one, for which I designed an appropriately weird brand. Localfu gets you talking with a likeminded local of the place you're traveling to, with an interface to plan your trip around their advice.</p><p>The landing page cycles between the different 'fu' characters, each who provides advice in the form of the app's actual UI elements. The goal was to communicate the concept of Localfu in a way that's so interesting people would actually give it a try.</p><p>It's all CSS animation. Yep, completely. That's just a screencap of a browser. I only built the scene though, and handed it off to the team to put into the real build.
